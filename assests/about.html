            <h1>Grooming</h1>
            <p> Oh yeah, I said grooming. Just because these cats have little to no fur doesnt make them low to mantain
              <br>
              You want high-quailty food to help regulate the oils produced in their skin, keeping them from having skin
              probelms or even infections. These kitties have no fur, they tend to leave grease spots on the
              areas that they frequent. “Their skin is oily, and that oil can seep into your couch cushions or bed
              sheets and leave a stain,” Dr. Verrilli says.Just fYI a good diet does more then just help keep them
              healthy. They also get dirt built up in their ears, so they need their ears gentally cleaned out with
              cotton balls about twice a week. Here is a good video to show you <a class="link"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI5EsO-UfnM"> how to clean their ears.</a>

              They also require baths. They
              should be bathed once every two weeks or at least once a month to help keep them clean. If you start this
              when they are kittens
              they will grow to love bath time!</p>

            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <p>Most people dont relate super clingy, attention seeker to the description of cats.. but sphynx cats are
              actually overly affectionate. If you've always wanted that lap cat that will cuddle with you and just love
              to be in your presence 24/7 then this breed if definetly for you!
              They truely are the sweetest cat breed out there. They usually do really well with kids and have a high
              temperment. They are very social cats that love to be around people and pets, they really are the perfect
              companion. A big reason why these cats love to cuddle so much is because they are actually using you for
              your body heat! They have a harder time regulating their body temperatures to stay warm because of the
              lack of fur. So a good idea is always keeps clothes on your little ones! Even getting an inexpensive <a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NICREW-Heating-Heated-Steel-Wrapped-Fleece/dp/B07KWMJHTB/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=cat%2Bheating%2Bpad&qid=1652561179&sr=8-6&th=1">heating pad</a>
               to help keep them warm would make all the differnce for them. Especially if you like to keep
              the a/c running cold in your house!
              They can also be very energetic and a little bit mischievous.
